#                              RainTracker
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This program tracks incoming rain for a user-selected area. The user enters
# a location to watch and RainTracker will tell them the probability of rain
# over the next 24 hours. It also looks at 10-day forecasts to see if any 
# storms are approaching the area. The application interacts with the user by
# using a GUI.

# Libraries

# Main application
def RainTracker():
    print("\n\n\tStarting RainTracker...\n\n")
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    print("\n\tClosing RainTracker...\n\n")

# Run the program
